/*
Notes to self:
- There are so many **Non_TG sessions in the cvr_data table** (contrary to the orders table) due to overlapping zones. Some Non_TG vendors in the dps_cvr_events table are associated with multiple zones (some of them could be our targeted ones).
However, in the orders table, they are tagged with completely different zones than the targeted ones because an order can only have one zone (that's BI's logic). This causes these orders to NOT be caught and the number of Non_TG **orders** to be so little, contrary
to the number of Non_TG **sessions**

- You can fix the **Non_TG sessions issue** by filtering out the sessions with Non_TG (i.e., not analysing them at all) OR filtering for the targeted zones by the **ST_CONTAINS** instead of **zone_id**. This applies to the sessions_mapped_to_orders_v2 table
as well as dps_cvr_events. However, these two tables do NOT have the location field. You will need to get it from cDWH.orders AND dps_sessions_mapped_to_ga_sessions
